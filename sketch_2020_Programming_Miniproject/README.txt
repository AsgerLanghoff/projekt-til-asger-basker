SOMETHING LIKE ATARI BREAKOUT, by Signe Toftgaard Henriksen:
For intro to programming, AAU, MED1.

This is a breakout game.
Control the paddle with the mouse and aim the ball.
Hit the bricks to score points, when all the bricks are hit, you win.
If you hit the ground you lose a life, you have 3 lives.
